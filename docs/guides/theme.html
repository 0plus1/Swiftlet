<h2>Theming</h2>

<p>
	One of the first things you might want to do when building a website is create a new theme.
	This is done by editing CSS and the header and footer <a href="../concepts/view">Views</a>.
</p>

<p>
	When a view is loaded the header and footer views are automatically included unless <code>standAlone</code>
	is set to <code>TRUE</code> in the <a href="../concepts/controller">Controller</a>. As the name suggests,
	the header view (<code>/_views/header.html.php</code>) contains the top part of the website and the footer
	(<code>/_views/footer.html.php</code>) the bottom part.
</p>

<p>
	Files that are used for the layout of the website are all located in the <code>/_views</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
	For the sake of simplicity Swiftlet does not support multiple themes out of the box. This could be achieved
	with the help of a custom plugin however.
