<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
	Swiftlet requires very little configuration. In fact, Swiftlet will work with no configuration at all.
	In most cases you do want to chance the default settings which can be done by editing the configuration
	file.
</p>

<p>
	The configuration file is located at <code>/_config.php</code>.

		set to a unique value which is difficult to guess.

		outdated information being displayed on the site.
