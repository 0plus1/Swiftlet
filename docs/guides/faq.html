<h4>I made changes to a page but the website still shows the old version.</h4>

<p>
	Try clearing the cache. You can do this from the <a href="../plugins/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
	or by manually deleting the files in <code>/cache/</code>. If you made changes to the
	database you can truncate the <code>sw_cache_queries</code> and <code>sw_cache_tables</code> tables. You
	can also turn caching off completely by changing the setting in <code>/_config.php</code>.
</p>

<h4>Why are <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_POST</code> always empty?</h4>

<p>
	Swiftlet has a safer way to handle GET and POST. In short, you should use <code>$this-&gt;app-&gt;input-&gt;POST_db_safe</code>,
	<code>$this-&gt;app-&gt;input-&gt;POST_html_safe</code> or <code>$this-&gt;app-&gt;input-&gt;POST_raw</code> where appropriate (the same for GET).
	See <a href="./input">Inputs</a> for more information.

<h4>I made a form but it doesn't work. There is no POST data when I submit it.</h4>

<p>
	If you're sending data using POST the field <code>auth-token</code> needs to be present otherwise the request
	is ignored. This is also the case with AJAX requests. See <a href="./input">Input</a> for more information.
