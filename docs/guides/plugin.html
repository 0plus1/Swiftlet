<h2>Creating plugins</h2>

<p>
	Swiftlet has a modular design. Almost all of it's functionality can be replaced, disabled or extended with plugins.
</p>

<p>
	To create a plugin, copy an existing plugin or start with an empty file in the <code>/_app/plugins/</code> directory.
	The name of the file will be the name of the plugin and should start with a capital letter (a convention for files
	containing a class).
</p>

<h4>Example plugin (<code>/_app/plugins/Example.php</code>)</h4>

<pre>
<?php
if ( !isset($this) ) die('Direct access to this file is not allowed');

class Example_Plugin extends Plugin
{
	public
		$version    = '1.0.0',
		$compatible = array('from' => '1.3.0', 'to' => '1.3.*'),
		$hooks      = array('init' => 1)
		;

	function init()
	{
		$this->ready = TRUE;
	}
}
?>
</pre>

<p>
	This is a very simple plugin that implements the 'init' hook (see <a href="../concepts/hook">Hooks</a>). This hook
	is called every time a page loads. The first line of the file is to make sure the plugin isn't being called directly
	from the browser.
</p>

<p>
	The name of the class must
	be the same as the name of the file suffixed by '_Plugin'. Each plugin extends the Plugin class (see
	<a href="../concepts/plugin">Plugins</a>).
</p>

<p>
	The next step is set up a few variables with information about the plugin.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>$version</code><br/>
		Version number of the plugin.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>$compatible</code><br/>
		The lowest and highest version numbers of Swiftlet that this plugin is compatible with. A wildcard character (*)
		may be used to specify multiple versions.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>$dependencies</code> (optional)<br/>
		An array containing the names of plugins that are required for the plugin to work.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>$hooks</code> (optional)<br/>
		List of <a href="../concepts/hook">hooks</a> the plugin utilizes and the order in which they should be executed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>$upgradable</code><br/>
		List of plugin version numbers that are upgradable to the current version.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating database tables</h3>

<p>
	In many cases plugins need access to the database and new tables need to be created. This can be done using the
	<em>install</em> hook. These plugins need to be installed through the plugin installer at <code>/installer/</code>.
	Here is a more elaborate example of a plugin:
</p>

<pre>
<?php
if ( !isset($this) ) die('Direct access to this file is not allowed');

class Example_Plugin extends Plugin
{
	public
		$version      = '1.1.0',
		$compatible   = array('from' => '1.3.0', 'to' => '1.3.*'),
		$dependencies = array('db'),
		$hooks        = array('install' => 1, 'upgrade' => 1, 'remove' => 1)
		$upgradable   = array('from' => '1.0.0', 'to' => '1.0.*'),
		;

	function install()
	{
		if ( !in_array($this->app->db->prefix . 'example', $this->app->db->tables) )
		{
			$this->app->db->sql('
				CREATE TABLE `' . $this->app->db->prefix . 'example` (
					`id`  INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
					`foo` VARCHAR(256)     NOT NULL,
					PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
					)
				;');
		}
	}

	function upgrade()
	{
		if ( in_array($this->app->db->prefix . 'example', $this->app->db->tables) )
		{
			$this->app->db->sql('
				ALTER TABLE `' . $this->app->db->prefix . 'example`
				CHANGE COLUMN "foo" "bar"
				;');
		}
	}

	function remove()
	{
		if ( in_array($this->app->db->prefix . 'example', $this->app->db->tables) )
		{
			$this->app->db->sql('DROP TABLE `' . $this->app->db->prefix . 'example`;');
		}
	}
?>
</pre>

<p>
	The <em>install</em>, <em>upgrade</em> and <em>remove</em> hooks are used by the plugin installer.
	Plugins can only be upgraded if the Swiftlet version matches the values in <code>$upgradable</code>
	(to go from version 1.0.x to 3.0.x, you usually have to upgrade to version 2.0.x first).
</p>

<p>
	Because this plugin requires a database, the <em>db</em> plugin should be declared as a dependency. This
	ensures the plugin will not be installed unless the <a href="../plugins/mysql">Database</a> plugin is
	installed and ready.
