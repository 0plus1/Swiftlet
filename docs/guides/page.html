<h2>Creating pages</h2>

<p>
	The easiest way to add a page to your website is using the <a href="../plugins/page">Page</a> plugin.
	After installation you'll find a link on the <a href="../plugins/dashboard">Dashboard</a> where you can add
	and edit pages. These pages can only contain static content such as text and images and are useful for simple
	documents and articles.
</p>

<p>
	To add a dynamic (scripted) page you need to create two files, a
	<a href="../concepts/controller">Controller</a> and a <a href="../concepts/view">View</a>.
</p>

<h4>Example Controller (<code>/hello.php</code>)</h4>

<pre>
<?php
$contrSetup = array(
    'rootPath'  => './',
    'pageTitle' => 'Hello'
    );

require($contrSetup['rootPath'] . '_model/init.php');

// Your code goes here

$view->load('hello.html.php');

$model->end();
?>
</pre>

<p>
	The <code>$contrSetup</code> variable is a requirement that lets you configure the Controller. The value of <code>rootPath</code>
	is the relative path to the root directory, in this case <code>./</code>. If you place the controller in a subdirectory it should
	be <code>../</code> or perhaps <code>../../</code>.
</p>

<p>
	The next step is to initialize <a href="../concepts/model">Model</a> by including <code>/_model/init.php</code>. Without the Model
	you won't be able to use any of Swiftlet's functions.
</p>

<p>
	At this point you can add your own PHP code.
</p>

<p>
	Now you can load the View file with <code>$view->load()</code>. This file will contain all the HTML and other UI elements. This way
	logic is separated from design which will make it easier to maintain.
</p>

<p>
	Finally you need to call <code>$model->end()</code> to finalize the request. This will make sure database connections are closed,
	sessions are saved and output is sent to the browser.
</p>

<p>
	When you browse to the Controller (<code>/hello.php</code>) in your web browser the page should appear.
