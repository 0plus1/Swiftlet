<h2>Helpers</h2>

<p>
	Helpers are snippets of code that can be called in <a href="./view">Views</a> to help with tasks and keep your code
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. Any code that you are repeating
	regularly can likely be moved into a helper.
</p>

<p>
	Helpers are stored in <code>/_views/_helpers/</code>.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
<?php

$this->helper('pagination', array('name' => 'users', 'page' => 1, 'pages' => 3));

?>
</pre>

<p>
	The helper function takes two arguments; the name of the helper you want to call and optionally an array of
	parameters. In the example's case the file <code>/_views/_helpers/pagination.hmtl.php</code> will be included to
	display pagination.
