<h2>Unit tests</h2>

<p>
	Swiftlet can perform automated tests to ensure everything keeps working as expected during plugin development.
	Unit test can be executed by going to <code>/unit_tests/</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Each <a href="./plugin">plugin</a> can include a number of tests, using the <em>unit_test</em> hook in the main plugin file.

This test simulates a form being submitted on the page <code>/example</code>. If the page handled the request
correctly the value "bar" was saved, which can be confirmed by checking the database.
