	Swiftlet is a light-weight web application framework written in PHP. It enables you to
	quickly deploy websites that are fast and secure. 
</p>

<p>
	Swiftlet is well written, well documented, completely free and open-source. It is
	extensible, flexible and doesn't get in your way. Swiftlet requires zero configuration
	and has few conventions to adhere.
</p>

<p>
	Swiftlet implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern to separate logic from design
	and takes advantage of PHP 5's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) capabilities.
