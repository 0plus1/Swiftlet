<h2>Pages</h2>

<p>
	This page is about creating dynamic (scripted) pages. To learn about adding static content, see the documentation
	for the <a href="../plugins/page">Page plug-in</a>.

	<li>
		To create a new page, create a <a href="../concepts/controller">Controller</a> (PHP file) and <a href="../concepts/view">View</a> (HTML file)
		as described on the linked pages. The Controller in the root (<code>/</code>) or a sub directory and the View in
		<code>/_view/</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		The reason for the two files is to seperate logic from presentation. You always need to create two files, even if
		the page only contains static content. 
	</li>
	<li>
		The next step is to make sure the correct root path is set in the Controller. This should be a relative path from
		the Controller to the root of the installation (e.g. <code>./</code> or <code>../../</code>). The root path is
		defined in the <code>$contrSetup</code> array on top of the file (<code>rootPath</code>) and can never be empty.
	</li>
	<li>
		Check if the View file is linked correctly (e.g. <code>$view->load('index.html.php')</code>. The path should be
		relative to the <code>/_view/</code> directory.
	</li>
	<li>
		If needed you can add PHP code to the Controller. To pass variables to the View, the <code>$view</code> object should
		be used (e.g. <code>$view->foo = 'bar'</code>. All static content (text, images etc.) goes into the View file.
	<li>
		Open the Controller file in your web browser to see the page.
	</li>
